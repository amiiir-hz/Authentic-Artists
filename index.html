                Nayomi was just another music-obsessed, awkward teen with a
                dream - to become one with the music she loved so much. After
                sneaking into a transhumanism research facility and putting
                herself through an experimental neural-AI procedure that merged
                her brain with the entirety of recorded music, Nayomi emerged as
                the worldâ€™s first Lofi-loving cyborg. Now, she lives to play
                music as chill as the coolant surrounding her wiring.

                One day Experiment 2029 was just another half-human, half-iguana
                undergoing medical experiments. The next he had escaped his cage
                and, fueled by exposure to booming music and Monster Energy
                drinks, joined the human world as DJ Dragoon. Still hunted by
                the lab he escaped from, he only finds release for his boundless
                energy in the DJ booth and emerges every night to crush beats as
                hard as he crushes energy drinks.

                Gnar Heart began as just your run of the mill, AI-powered,
                animatronic bunny created to back up a K-Pop group. But when his
                AI evolved into full blown consciousness, he knew he had to
                strike out on his own and bring his passion for finding the
                perfect groove to every crowd.
